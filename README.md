This extension packages a small set of SillyTavern responsiveness fixes as a third-party extension.

What it does:

- Guards `AutoComplete` reposition work so inactive instances do not recompute layout on every mobile `resize`
- Replaces the stock `power-user` window `resize` handler with a version that exits early on mobile before expensive autocomplete and hotswap refresh work runs
- Speeds up opening the chat file manager for normal character chats by rendering a lightweight file-name list first, then using one full metadata request to fill in file size, message count, date, and preview text
- Opens normal character recent chats from the welcome page directly to the clicked chat file, avoiding an intermediate render of the character's previously active chat
- Speeds up opening and closing World Info entry editors by skipping the expensive height animation for top-level entry drawers, keeping initialized editors alive while collapsed, and lazily initializing heavier Select2 controls and character filter options
- Speeds up OpenAI preset switching by letting the mobile preset select close first, rendering the prompt list immediately, suppressing the stock one-second delayed rebuild for that switch, and refreshing token counts afterward
- Speeds up prompt preset toggles and saves by updating only the affected prompt row immediately, then refreshing token counts after a short debounce instead of rebuilding the whole prompt list on every click
- Optionally saves the current OpenAI preset after a prompt entry edit is saved; this switch is off by default
- Allows the message editor to open immediately after deleting messages with SillyTavern's delete-message mode, and submits that fast-opened edit before replaying common generation actions
- Prevents mobile auto-focus from opening the keyboard when entering message edit mode or opening the chat file manager while preserving manual input focus
- Suppresses chat scroll compensation caused by mobile keyboard layout resize while editing messages
- Adds a SillyTavern extension settings panel with separate switches for the responsiveness, chat file manager, and prompt preset features

The chat file manager optimization only applies when:

- the request is for `/api/chats/search`
- the search query is empty
- the current target is a normal character chat, not a group chat

Keyword searches and group chats fall back to SillyTavern's original `/api/chats/search` behavior.

The prompt preset switch optimization only applies to the OpenAI/chat-completion prompt manager. It applies prompt list fields before the rest of the preset switch finishes so the list can repaint earlier. Its fast renderer uses indexed prompt lookups and delegated row actions to avoid repeated per-row searches and listener binding. When deleting the selected OpenAI preset, it selects the next preset in the list, or the first preset when deleting the last one. It preserves SillyTavern's original behavior when disabled.

The prompt preset quick-operation optimization only applies to existing rows in the OpenAI/chat-completion prompt manager list. New prompt creation still falls back to SillyTavern's original behavior because it changes the available prompt list. The feature switch preserves SillyTavern's original behavior when disabled.

The prompt entry auto-save feature is disabled by default. When enabled, saving an OpenAI prompt entry also triggers the current OpenAI preset save action after the prompt edit has been written.

The delete-message edit flow optimization only applies shortly after confirming SillyTavern's delete-message dialog. It opens the requested message editor directly during that cleanup window, then delays common send, regenerate, continue, and impersonate clicks until the fast-opened edit has been submitted. The feature switch preserves SillyTavern's original behavior when disabled.

For local testing inside this repository, the extension can live under:

- `public/scripts/extensions/third-party/SillyTavern-Mobile-Resize-Guard`

For end-user Git installation through SillyTavern's third-party extension installer, publish the contents of this folder at the root of a separate repository so that `manifest.json` is at the repository root.
